# Password_Generator
Generates password and saves it in a file ^_^

Its a simple password generator
It can generate password of any length

Difference between hex & base64
#hex : It generates password only with numbers and lower case alphabets.
#base64 : It generates password with numbers, symbols, upper case alphabets and lower case alphabets.

Personally I suggest to use base64

Commands:
$cd Password_Generator
$ls
$bash password_generator.sh
Then just do as you are told.

Thanks for using my tool. ^_^
